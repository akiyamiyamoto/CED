    New features (H. Hoelbe, DESY): 
        - Remote access to CED: 
            * Per default CED rejects connects from remote hosts, to
              enable remote access, start CED with option -trust <hostname>. 

            * Example: To allow remote access from host xyz: 
                   glced -trust xyz

        - Use user defined port:
            * To start ced several times on the same host, it is necessary 
              that each instance of CED use a different port. To do that, 
              you are able to set the CED port by set the enviroment 
              variable CED_PORT.

            * Example: Start CED listen on port 8888:
                    export CED_PORT=8888
                    glced

            * Hint: To connect on this CED with Marlin you must set
              the enviroment variable CED_PORT (and for remote access 
              also CED_HOST) before starting Marlin.

    Fixes/Intern stuff
        - Move (Middle mouse button): 
               * Now works correct with rotate
               * Adjusted the move speed, to get the same speed for
                 each zoom level and window size.

        - rotate3d:
              * Helper function: rotates a vector in the 3d room

        - ced_geobox_r_ID:
              * do the same as ced_geobox_r (plus lcio_id) but use
                ced_line_ID, this ensure working picking, fisheye view and
                layerdescription. All other geobox functions ced_geobox_r,
                ced_geobox_ID, ced_geobox, now can use this new function
                instead of having own code.

    Simplified CMakeLists ( added dependency to ILCUTIL package )

      add layer descriptions use MarlinCED:set_layer_description or
      MarlinCED:add_layer_description. 
    - Added test_ced_mhits (draws 1.000.000 random hits)

    changes/bug fixes: (H. Hoelbe, DESY)

       or using the popup menu
    -  removed old makefiles

 --------
| v00-05 |
 --------
      * restructered build process: 
        default is to build true client library libCED.so 
        - optionally also build CED server glced (needs glut/OpenGL)
          with cmake switch -D CED_SERVER=ON 

      * install only ced_cli.h 

 -----------
| v00-04-01 |

	 -  added layer functionality to CED_GeoBoxR
	 -  added a unique id variable (int) to CED_Hit, which is printed to
		screen whenever the 'C' key is pressed to center on a hit
