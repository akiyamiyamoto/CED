    - New features (H. Hoelbe, DESY):
        * Add screenshot function
            - Select screenshot from popup menu, resolution options depending on the size of your glced window. 
              This will save a screenshot under /tmp/glced.tga. 
              To convert the screenshot into a compressed format Use for example "convert /tmp/glced.tga screenshot.png".
        * New help frame
            - New concept: not a extra window. Insteat a orthogonal projection inside of the original ced window
              this should fix: focus problems, crashes, and its transparence now
            - Detector and data layer now also have a visibility field which is shown
            - Help frame now change its size in hight so that always all elements fit into it
    
    - Changes/Bugfixes
        * Removed grafical artifact in detector components who have differ amount of inner and outer edges
        * Outer line of detector are now smooth and are drawn at least to remove a grafical artifact
        * Add fading into the background color for bigger distance as a menu feature.
        * New order of popup menu items
        * Add some new shortcut keys
        * Add 4 extra slots to save user settings
        * fixed typo S for F and added brackets for ((a && b) || (c && d))  if condition
        * renamed MAX_LAYER to CED_MAX_LAYER in order to avoid name clashes with other tools (e.g. calice event display )

| v01-03 |
 --------

   - New features (H. Hoelbe, DESY):
        * Save/Load settings option (saves zoom, background color, view position, etc in ~/.glced)
        * Detector components have now layers and layer description
        * Increased the number of available layers 
        * Add side view projection (press 'S' to toggle)
        * Add front view projection (press 'F' to toggle)
        * Add perspectivical option (objects far away apairs smaller)
        * Its possible to toggle the visible of the axes (select it from the menu)
        * Show frames per secounds (select it from the menu) 
        * Enhanced fisheye view by adding zoom levels when view mode toggles,
          or when switches to side, front or reset view

        * Add a new optional draw style for the detector, called "New view" includes: 
            * Detector cuts: longitudinal (press and hold 'z' or 'Z') 
              and transversal cuts (select it from the menu) 
            * Its possible to change the value of the transparence (menu)
            * in 3d-view also added a line model for better identification
            * Inner edges can be different from outeredges, and the inner cylinder can be 
              rotated with an other angle as the outer cylinder shape
            * Its possible to set a flag in GEO_Tube objects, so that they only 
              get drawn in new view, see marlinCED.c for an example


   * Fixes/Intern stuff (H. Hoelbe, DESY):
        * Fixed mouse-wheel functionality for Ubuntu
        * Changed CED from a c to a c++ project
        * Change order of drawing items 
        * Removed zoom level reset from side and front view
        * Update deepfilter and blend function


    - added OpenGL library paths to the rpath list for preventing LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        (set by geant4 env init script) to overwrite the opengl system libraries used
        in the linking of glced with the ones from Mesa (installed in afs), which might
        cause a dramatic performance penalty

    New features (H. Hoelbe, DESY): 
        - Remote access to CED: 
            * Per default CED rejects connects from remote hosts, to
              enable remote access, start CED with option --trust <hostname>. 

            * Example: To allow remote access from host xyz: 
                   glced --trust xyz

        - Use user defined port:
            * To start ced several times on the same host, it is necessary 
              that each instance of CED use a different port. To do that, 
              you are able to set the CED port by set the enviroment 
              variable CED_PORT.

            * Example: Start CED listen on port 8888:
                    export CED_PORT=8888
                    glced

            * Hint: To connect on this CED with Marlin you must set
              the enviroment variable CED_PORT (and for remote access 
              also CED_HOST) before starting Marlin.

    Fixes/Intern stuff
        - Move (Middle mouse button): 
               * Now works correct with rotate
               * Adjusted the move speed, to get the same speed for
                 each zoom level and window size.

        - rotate3d:
              * Helper function: rotates a vector in the 3d room

        - ced_geobox_r_ID:
              * do the same as ced_geobox_r (plus lcio_id) but use
                ced_line_ID, this ensure working picking, fisheye view and
                layerdescription. All other geobox functions ced_geobox_r,
                ced_geobox_ID, ced_geobox, now can use this new function
                instead of having own code.

    Simplified CMakeLists ( added dependency to ILCUTIL package )
